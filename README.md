This project delves into economic modeling and forecasting using advanced time series analysis techniques. Historical data sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) is utilized, transforming quarterly data into annualized series.
The analysis involves rigorous statistical testing to assess the stationarity and normality of the data series. Kernel density plots are employed to visualize the distribution characteristics, providing insights into data patterns and potential outliers.
Time series plots are constructed to depict trends, averages, and deviations over time. Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)- Neo Keynesian nonlinear model equations are formulated and parameters of the model are estimated. Policy, transition, and covariance matrix
are calculated. The steady state of the model is derived and analyzed to understand its equilibrium conditions. Impulses (shocks) are engineered and their responses to the variables are captured. The model is then used to forecast inflation for 12 quarters.
