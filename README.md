This project delves into economic modeling and forecasting using advanced time series analysis techniques. Historical data sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) is utilized, focusing on transforming quarterly data into annualized series.
The analysis involves rigorous statistical testing to assess the stationarity and normality of the data series. Kernel density plots are employed to visualize the distribution characteristics, providing insights into data patterns and potential outliers.
Time series plots are constructed to depict trends, averages, and deviations over time. Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model equations are formulated and parameters of the DSGE model are estimated. Policy, transition ans covariance matrix
are calulated.The steady state of the DSGE model is derived and analyzed to understand its equilibrium conditions. Impulses (shocks) are engineers and their response on the variablers are captured. The model is then used to forcast inflation for 12 quarters.
